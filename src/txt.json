  "exampleText": "Accessible web pages refer to web pages that can be easily used by everyone, including those with disabilities. This includes features such as high contrast mode, large text options, and alternative text descriptions for images. Accessible web pages also use proper coding techniques to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies such as screen readers. Making web pages accessible not only benefits individuals with disabilities, but also makes the website easier to use for everyone, improving the user experience for all."
